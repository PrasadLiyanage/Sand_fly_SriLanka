Author Summary:

Leishmaniasis, a public health problem in the tropics is caused by  Leishmania species parasites and transmitted by sand flies. Both climatic and non-climatic factors may affect sand fly ecology. The goal herein was to understand how these factors influence sand fly density in 10 field sites across Sri Lanka with varying eco-climatic conditions. 
Monthly collections of sand flies over 24 months were analysed, and the influence of climate and land use patterns on the sand fly density was estimated. The results indicated that climate has a more significant impact on sand fly density compared to land use factors. An increase in rainfall and relative humidity were associated with a prominent increase in sand fly density. Similar effects were seen with the rise of ambient and soil temperature, and evaporation rates, albeit with a 2-month lag period. The increase in ambient temperature, sunshine hours, and evaporation rate at real-time, however, uniformly reduced sand fly density.  Large land areas of chena and coconut plantations, along with sparse forests, homesteads, and reduced human footprint indices, positively influenced sand fly density. The dry zone appeared to have an increased risk of higher sand fly densities compared to the wet zone. The findings promote a better understanding of the changing climatic and environmental influence on sand fly vectors, leishmaniasis spread, and providing a foundation for the development of targeted interventions for vector and disease control.
